The code is an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm, which sorts an array of numbers in ascending order. 
It works by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the one before it. 
If the element is smaller than the previous one, they are swapped. 
This process continues until the entire array is sorted.
The outer loop iterates over the elements of the array from index 1 to the second-to-last element (index length(A)-1), where i is the index of the current element being considered for sorting.
The variable j is initialized to the same value as i.
The inner loop runs as long as j is greater than zero and the element A[j] is less than the previous element A[j-1]. 
This loop iterates backwards from the current index j to the beginning of the array, checking whether the current element is smaller than the previous one.
If the condition of the inner loop is met, the current element A[j] is swapped with the previous element A[j-1], effectively moving the current element backwards one position in the array.
After the swap, the value of j is decremented by 1 to continue the inner loop and check whether the current element is still smaller than the previous one.
When the inner loop has completed running, the current element at index i is now sorted in its correct position in the array, with all elements before it also sorted.
The outer loop proceeds to the next element at index i+1, and the process repeats until all elements have been sorted in ascending order.
